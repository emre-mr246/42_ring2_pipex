## Introduction 🚀

We are writing a program in this project to simulate the pipe '|' operator.

## Usage 🔍

1. In the project's main directory, compile the library using the `make` or 'make bonus' command.
   `$ make` 

2.  After compilation, you can run the program as follows:
    `./pipex_bonus infile cmd1 cmd2 ... cmdn outfile`
    `./pipex_bonus here_doc limiter cmd1 cmd2 ... cmdn outfile`
